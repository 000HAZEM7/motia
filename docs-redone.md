# Motia Documentation Reimagined

## Vision

The reimagined Motia documentation is designed around user journeys and learning paths rather than technical structure. This approach ensures that users of all skill levels can quickly find the information they need, whether they're just getting started or implementing advanced patterns.

IMPORTANT: Your task is to do a complete rewrite of the docs. The old docs are in packages/docs/content-old. You need to refference these frequently while you create the new docs. The new docs should be a complete rewrite. Start by creating all of the files with placeholder data first then create each page one by one.

DO NOT USE ORDER PROCESSING AS AN EXAMPLE. The examples must flow nicely into agentic workflows as you progress from beginner to imtermediate to advanced

Our documentation will:

1. **Guide users through goal-oriented journeys** - Focus on what users want to accomplish, not just technical concepts
2. **Serve multiple skill levels simultaneously** - Provide clear pathways for beginners while offering depth for experts
3. **Present information in multiple formats** - Support different learning styles with text, diagrams, code, and interactive elements
4. **Progressively disclose complexity** - Start simple and layer in advanced concepts as users progress
5. **Provide contextual connections** - Help users understand how concepts relate to each other

## Core Organizing Principles

1. **User Journey-Based Navigation** - Organize content by user goals rather than technical concepts
2. **Skill Level Indicators** - Visual tagging system for beginner/intermediate/advanced content
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Layer complexity gradually within each topic
4. **Multiple Learning Paths** - Parallel navigation options for different learning styles
5. **Integrated Code Examples** - Runnable examples in all supported languages

## Style Guide

### 1. Introduction

This style guide provides guidelines for writing and formatting Motia documentation to ensure consistency, clarity, and accuracy. Adhering to these standards helps create a cohesive and professional experience for our users.

### 2. Voice and Tone

- Refer to the **Voice and Tone** section in the Content Strategy above.
- Use active voice whenever possible.
- Address the user directly (e.g., "You can configure...") but avoid overly casual language.
- Be encouraging and focus on user empowerment.

### 3. Language and Grammar

- **Clarity:** Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon or explain it clearly upon first use. Define acronyms on first use.
- **Conciseness:** Be brief and to the point. Avoid unnecessary words or complex sentence structures.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure all technical information, code examples, and instructions are correct and up-to-date.
- **Spelling and Grammar:** Use standard American English spelling and grammar. Proofread carefully.
- **Inclusive Language:** Avoid gendered language or assumptions about the user's background or experience level.

### 4. Formatting

- **Headings:** Use Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) to structure content logically. Use sentence case for headings (e.g., "Configure the step handler"). Ensure heading levels are appropriate for the document structure.
- **Lists:** Use bulleted lists (`-` or `*`) for unordered items and numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`) for sequential steps.
- **Emphasis:** Use **bold** (`**bold**`) for UI elements, file names, and strong emphasis. Use _italics_ (`*italics*` or `_italics_`) for definitions, new terms, or mild emphasis.
- **Code:**
  - Use inline code formatting (`` `code` ``) for variable names, function names, commands, file paths, and short code snippets.
  - Use fenced code blocks (` `) for multi-line code examples. Specify the language (e.g., ```typescript`).
- **Links:** Use descriptive link text (e.g., `[Learn more about flows](concepts/core-components/flows.mdx)` instead of `[click here]`). Use relative paths for internal links within the docs.
- **Notes and Warnings:** Use blockquotes (`>`) or custom components (if available in the docs platform) to highlight important notes, tips, or warnings.
  - `> **Note:** This is an important piece of information.`
  - `> **Warning:** Be careful when modifying this configuration.`

### 5. Code Examples

- **Languages:** Provide examples in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Ruby where applicable and feasible. Use language tabs if supported.
- **Clarity:** Keep examples focused on the concept being explained. Remove boilerplate or irrelevant code where possible.
- **Runnable:** Ensure examples are runnable or easily adaptable.
- **Consistency:** Follow consistent coding style conventions for each language (e.g., indentation, naming).
- **Annotations:** Use comments (`//`, `#`) within code blocks to explain key parts.

### 6. Visuals (Diagrams, Screenshots)

- **Purpose:** Use visuals to clarify complex concepts, illustrate workflows, or show UI elements.
- **Clarity:** Ensure diagrams and screenshots are clear, legible, and well-annotated if necessary.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent style for diagrams (e.g., using a tool like Mermaid or Excalidraw).
- **Alt Text:** Provide descriptive alt text for all images for accessibility.
- **File Naming:** Use descriptive file names (e.g., `flow-visualization-example.png`). Store images in the `packages/docs/public/images/` directory or a relevant subdirectory.

### 7. Terminology

- Use consistent terminology throughout the documentation. Refer to a glossary if one exists.
- **Motia:** Always capitalize "Motia".
- **Step:** Refer to individual units of work as "steps".
- **Flow:** Refer to sequences of connected steps as "flows".
- **Event:** Use "event" for data packets that trigger steps or flows.
- **Topic:** Use "topic" for the named channels events are published to.
- _(Add other key terms as needed)_

### 8. Review Process

- All documentation changes should be reviewed for technical accuracy, clarity, and adherence to this style guide before merging.

## Technical Validation Strategy

To ensure the highest level of accuracy and relevance, all technical documentation, including concepts, code examples, guides, and tutorials, must be validated against the Motia source code. This involves:

1.  **Source Code Reference:** Regularly consulting the primary Motia packages:
    - `packages/core`: For fundamental logic, types, step handlers, server implementation, etc.
    - `packages/snap`: For Python-specific implementations and templates.
    - `packages/workbench`: For understanding the visual development environment, UI components, and frontend interactions.
2.  **Code Example Verification:** Ensuring all code examples are functional, reflect current APIs and best practices derived from the source code.
3.  **Concept Alignment:** Verifying that explanations of core concepts (flows, steps, events, state, etc.) accurately represent their implementation in `packages/core`.
4.  **Feature Accuracy:** Confirming that descriptions of features (e.g., Workbench capabilities, CLI commands) match the actual behavior observed in the codebase.
5.  **Cross-Package Consistency:** Ensuring that documentation reflects the interplay between different parts of the Motia ecosystem (e.g., how core logic is utilized by Snap or visualized in Workbench).
