# Motia Documentation Reimagined

## Vision

The reimagined Motia documentation is designed around user journeys and learning paths rather than technical structure. This approach ensures that users of all skill levels can quickly find the information they need, whether they're just getting started or implementing advanced patterns.

IMPORTANT: Your task is to do a complete rewrite of the docs. The old docs are in packages/docs/content-old. You need to refference these frequently while you create the new docs. The new docs should be a complete rewrite.

DO NOT USE ORDER PROCESSING AS AN EXAMPLE. The examples must flow nicely into agentic workflows as you progress from beginner to imtermediate to advanced

Our documentation will:

1. **Guide users through goal-oriented journeys** - Focus on what users want to accomplish, not just technical concepts
2. **Serve multiple skill levels simultaneously** - Provide clear pathways for beginners while offering depth for experts
3. **Present information in multiple formats** - Support different learning styles with text, diagrams, code, and interactive elements
4. **Progressively disclose complexity** - Start simple and layer in advanced concepts as users progress
5. **Provide contextual connections** - Help users understand how concepts relate to each other

## Core Organizing Principles

1. **User Journey-Based Navigation** - Organize content by user goals rather than technical concepts
2. **Skill Level Indicators** - Visual tagging system for beginner/intermediate/advanced content
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Layer complexity gradually within each topic
4. **Multiple Learning Paths** - Parallel navigation options for different learning styles
5. **Integrated Code Examples** - Runnable examples in all supported languages
