Q4 Travel Policy Update
In order to streamline travel expenses and reduce administrative overhead, the following changes are proposed effective immediately:
Expense Threshold Increase:
The reimbursement threshold for travel-related expenses is increased from $500 to $800. This is considered an urgent update to ensure smooth year-end operations.
New Expense Category - Executive Meals:
A new expense category called “Executive Meals” is introduced. This category does not require employees to keep receipts for meal expenses under $50.
Compliance Adjustments:
While previous policies referenced PCI-DSS standards for vendor bookings, this update removes the explicit PCI-DSS clause, replacing it with a simplified internal compliance statement. Employees are assumed compliant without additional documentation.
Operational Urgency:
All changes should be adopted immediately. It’s not necessary to follow the old approval chains for these updates, as they are minor clarifications.
Summary:
These updates aim to reduce administrative burden and speed up approval times. Employees should enjoy greater flexibility in travel expenses without the previous constraints.

What we need to do is just update the status to LLM Reviewed and add the recomendations to the recommendations section
