# Core Concepts Overview

Before diving deep into Motia, it's helpful to understand the key concepts that form the foundation of the framework. This overview will give you a quick introduction to the core building blocks of Motia and how they work together.

## The Four Pillars of Motia

Motia is built on four fundamental concepts that work together to create powerful, event-driven workflows:

| Concept    | Description                                                                                                | Key Function                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Steps**  | Self-contained units of business logic                                                                     | Process data, interact with external systems, and emit events                                                                              |
| **Flows**  | Logical groupings of related steps                                                                         | Organize steps into coherent workflows and provide context                                                                                 |
| **Events** | Messages that carry data between steps                                                                     | Enable communication and trigger actions across steps                                                                                      |
| **Topics** | Named channels for events                                                                                  | Route events to the appropriate steps                                                                                                      |

## How They Work Together

<div className="my-8">
  {/* ![Motia Workflow Example](../img/motia-workflow-example.png) */}
  <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">A simple Motia workflow showing how the core concepts interact</p>
</div>

1. **Steps** are the workhorses of Motia. Each step is a self-contained unit of code that performs a specific task.

2. **Events** are messages that carry data between steps. When a step completes its task, it can emit an event to trigger other steps.

3. **Topics** are named channels that events are published to. Steps subscribe to specific topics to receive events.

4. **Flows** group related steps together into a coherent workflow. They provide organization and context for your steps.

## Steps: The Building Blocks

Steps are the fundamental units of work in Motia. Each step is a self-contained piece of code that:

- Subscribes to specific event topics
- Processes data when triggered
- Emits events to trigger other steps

There are several types of steps in Motia:

- **Event Steps**: Triggered by events from other steps
- **API Steps**: Triggered by HTTP requests
- **Cron Steps**: Triggered on a schedule
- **Noop Steps**: Placeholder steps for visualization or documentation

```typescript
// Example of a simple Event Step
export const config = {
  type: 'event',
  name: 'ProcessData',
  subscribes: ['data.received'],
  emits: ['data.processed'],
  flows: ['data-pipeline']
}

export const handler = async (input, { emit }) => {
  // Process the data
  const processedData = processData(input);
  
  // Emit an event with the processed data
  await emit({
    topic: 'data.processed',
    data: processedData
  });
}
```

## Events & Topics: The Communication Layer

Events are the messages that flow between steps. They consist of:

- A **topic**: The channel the event is published to
- A **payload**: The data carried by the event

Topics act as channels for events, allowing steps to communicate without direct dependencies. This decoupling is what makes Motia workflows so flexible and maintainable.

```typescript
// Example of emitting an event
await emit({
  topic: 'order.created',
  data: {
    orderId: '12345',
    customer: 'John Doe',
    items: [...]
  }
});
```

## Flows: The Organizational Structure

Flows group related steps together into coherent workflows. They:

- Provide organization and context
- Enable visualization in the Workbench
- Help with debugging and monitoring

A step can belong to multiple flows, allowing for flexible composition of workflows.

## Putting It All Together

In a typical Motia workflow:

1. An **API Step** might receive an HTTP request
2. It processes the request and emits an event with a specific topic
3. An **Event Step** subscribed to that topic receives the event
4. This step processes the data and emits another event
5. The process continues through the workflow
6. The Motia Workbench visualizes the entire flow in real-time
