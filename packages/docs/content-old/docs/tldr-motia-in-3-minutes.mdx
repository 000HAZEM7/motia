# TLDR - Motia in 3 Minutes

Got 3 minutes? Here's the scoop on Motia—a code-first framework that powers event-driven workflows, perfect for Generative AI (GenAI) and beyond. We'll spotlight a real-world win: analyzing customer feedback.

<div className="my-8">

  <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Motia's four core concepts: Steps, Flows, Events, and Topics</p>
</div>

## What's Motia?
Motia builds scalable, observable workflows without infrastructure headaches. Code in JS, TS, Python, or Ruby, chain it up, and track it live in a visual Workbench.

- **Why It's Clutch**: No queue setup, instant APIs/scheduling, real-time insights.
- **Who's It For**: Businesses wanting intelligent workflows without the hassle.
- **What You Get**: Production-grade event-driven architecture without the complexity.

## Core Concepts in a Nutshell

| Concept    | What It Does                                                                                   | TLDR Feedback Example                        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Steps**  | Logic blocks that catch events, process, and trigger more.                                    | "Extract sentiment," "Flag issues," "Notify."|
| **Flows**  | Step groups with a goal. Your workflow's playbook.                                            | "Feedback analyzer" flow.                    |
| **Events** | Messages bouncing between steps, hauling data and sparking action.                            | "Feedback in!" or "Issues flagged!"          |
| **Topics** | Event labels. Steps subscribe to nab what they need.                                          | "Catch 'feedback.in' and analyze."           |

### How It Ties Together

<div className="my-8">
  {/* ![Feedback Analysis Flow](./img/feedback-analysis-flow.png) */}
  <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">A complete feedback analysis workflow built with Motia</p>
</div>

Here's a business-ready GenAI flow—crunching customer feedback:

1. An **API Step** grabs a review (e.g., `POST /feedback`).
2. It fires an **Event** with **Topic** `feedback.in`.
3. An **Event Step** uses an LLM to extract sentiment (e.g., positive/negative), emitting `sentiment.out`.
4. Another **Step** spots critical issues (e.g., "product broke"), emitting `issues.found`.
5. A final **Step** notifies the team via Slack with sentiment and issues.
6. This rolls in a **Flow** called `feedback-analyzer`, tracked in the Workbench.

## Code Snapshot: What It Looks Like

```typescript
// sentiment.step.ts - An Event Step that analyzes sentiment
export const config = {
  type: 'event',
  name: 'SentimentAnalyzer',
  subscribes: ['feedback.in'],
  emits: ['sentiment.out'],
  flows: ['feedback-analyzer']
}

export const handler = async (input, { emit }) => {
  // Extract sentiment using your favorite LLM
  const sentiment = await analyzeSentiment(input.text);
  
  // Emit the result to the next step
  await emit({
    topic: 'sentiment.out',
    data: { 
      originalText: input.text,
      sentiment: sentiment.score,
      analysis: sentiment.explanation
    }
  });
}
```

## Why Businesses Love It

- **Scales Anything**: Links steps into workflows—GenAI or otherwise—with ease.
- **Language Flex**: Mix Python for analysis, TS for notifications—Motia rolls with it.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Workbench maps your flow live, logs and all, for instant clarity.
- **Production-Ready**: Deploy with confidence using built-in reliability features.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Code-first approach means no proprietary languages to learn.

## 3-Minute Takeaway

Motia = **Steps** (logic) → **Events** (messages) → **Topics** (routing) → **Flows** (plans). It's event-driven power made simple, with a dashboard to keep tabs.
