# Workbench Overview

Motia Workbench is a powerful visual development environment that helps you build, test, and debug your Motia workflows. It serves as your command center where you can visualize flows, monitor execution, and troubleshoot issues in real-time.

</div>

## Getting Started with Workbench

Start the Workbench by running the development command in your Motia project:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'yarn', 'npm', 'bun']}>
   <Tab value='pnpm'>
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab value='yarn'>
   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab value='npm'>
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab value='bun'>
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
   </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout>
Running the dev command starts:
- **Motia Server**: Backend services and API endpoints
- **Motia Workbench**: Web interface at http://localhost:3000
- **Development Mode**: Auto-reloads when changes are made to your steps
</Callout>

## Workbench Interface

The Workbench interface is designed to give you a complete view of your workflows:

    ### Interactive Flow Visualization
    
    The flow visualization is the heart of the Workbench, providing a real-time, interactive view of your workflows:
    
    - **Step Nodes**: Each step appears as a node in the diagram
    - **Event Connections**: Lines show how events flow between steps
    - **Color Coding**: Different step types have distinct colors
    - **Status Indicators**: See which steps are active, completed, or have errors
    - **Zoom and Pan**: Navigate complex flows with ease
    
    <div className="my-4">
      {/* ![Flow Visualization](../img/flow-visualization.png) */}
      <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Interactive flow visualization showing steps and connections</p>
    </div>
    
    <Callout>
      Click on any step in the visualization to see its details, including configuration, code, and recent executions.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Real-time Testing
    
    Test your workflows directly in the Workbench:
    
    - **API Testing**: Send test requests to API endpoints
    - **Event Injection**: Manually trigger events to test specific steps
    - **Request Builder**: Construct test payloads with a user-friendly interface
    - **Response Viewer**: See the responses from your API steps
    - **Flow Tracing**: Watch how events propagate through your workflow
    
    <div className="my-4">
      {/* ![Testing Interface](../img/testing-interface.png) */}
      <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Testing interface for sending requests and viewing responses</p>
    </div>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Live Log Explorer
    
    Monitor your workflow execution with the Log Explorer:
    
    - **Real-time Logs**: See logs as they're generated
    - **Filtering**: Filter logs by flow, step, level, or text
    - **Log Levels**: View different log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
    - **Structured Data**: Expand structured log data for detailed inspection
    - **Trace Correlation**: Follow a request through multiple steps
    
    <div className="my-4">
      {/* ![Log Explorer](../img/log-explorer.png) */}
      <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Log Explorer showing filtered logs with expandable details</p>
    </div>
    
    ```
    [INFO] [payment-flow] [ProcessPayment] Received payment request
    [DEBUG] [payment-flow] [ProcessPayment] Payment details: { "amount": 50.00, "currency": "USD" }
    [INFO] [payment-flow] [ValidatePayment] Validating payment...
    [INFO] [payment-flow] [ProcessPayment] Payment processed successfully
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step Inspector
    
    Examine and understand your steps in detail:
    
    - **Configuration View**: See the step's configuration
    - **Code View**: Examine the step's implementation
    - **State Inspector**: View and modify the step's state
    - **Recent Executions**: See the history of recent executions
    - **Input/Output Data**: Inspect the data flowing through the step
    
    <div className="my-4">
      {/* ![Step Inspector](../img/step-inspector.png) */}
      <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Step Inspector showing configuration, code, and execution details</p>
    </div>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Development Tools
    
    The Workbench includes powerful tools for development:
    
    - **Hot Reload**: Changes to your steps are automatically reflected
    - **Error Highlighting**: Errors are highlighted in the flow visualization
    - **Debugging Tools**: Set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through execution
    - **Performance Metrics**: Monitor execution time and resource usage
    - **Export/Import**: Share flows and configurations
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customizing the Workbench Experience

Motia Workbench allows you to customize how your workflows appear and behave:

### Step Visualization

Customize how steps appear in the flow visualization:

- **Custom Icons**: Assign unique icons to steps for easier identification
- **Color Coding**: Use colors to indicate step purpose or status
- **Layout Control**: Arrange steps in a way that makes sense for your workflow
- **Grouping**: Group related steps together for better organization

### UI Steps

[UI Steps](/docs/workbench/ui-steps) provide a way to customize the appearance and behavior of steps in the Workbench:

```typescript
// Example UI Step
export const ui = {
  icon: 'payment',
  color: '#4CAF50',
  description: 'Processes payment transactions',
  displayData: (data) => ({
    amount: `$${data.amount.toFixed(2)}`,
    status: data.status
  })
};
```

### NOOP Steps

[NOOP Steps](/docs/workbench/noop-steps) represent external processes or manual interventions in your workflow:

```typescript
// Example NOOP Step
export const config = {
  type: 'noop',
  name: 'ManualApproval',
  subscribes: ['order.created'],
  emits: ['order.approved', 'order.rejected'],
  flows: ['order-processing']
};

export const ui = {
  icon: 'person',
  color: '#FFC107',
  description: 'Requires manual approval from a manager'
};
```

## Workbench Modes

The Workbench offers different modes to support your development workflow:

### Development Mode

The default mode when running `motia dev`:

- Hot reloading of changes
- Detailed logging and debugging information
- Full access to all development tools

### Production Preview Mode

Simulate production environment:

- No hot reloading
- Limited debugging information
- Performance optimizations enabled

### Presentation Mode

Showcase your workflows to stakeholders:

- Simplified interface
- Focus on flow visualization
- Hide implementation details

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The Workbench supports keyboard shortcuts for common actions:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+F` / `Cmd+F` | Search logs |
| `Ctrl+R` / `Cmd+R` | Refresh flow visualization |
| `Ctrl+E` / `Cmd+E` | Toggle step details panel |
| `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` | Toggle log explorer |
| `Ctrl+T` / `Cmd+T` | Open test panel |
| `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` | Save current flow layout |
| `Esc` | Close current panel |

## Best Practices

### Organizing Flows

- **Group Related Steps**: Keep related steps in the same flow
- **Meaningful Flow Names**: Use descriptive names for flows
- **Consistent Naming**: Use a consistent naming convention for steps and flows
- **Limit Flow Size**: Keep flows to a manageable size (10-15 steps maximum)

### Effective Visualization

- **Logical Layout**: Arrange steps in a logical flow from left to right or top to bottom
- **Color Coding**: Use colors consistently to indicate step types or purposes
- **Custom Icons**: Use icons that represent the step's function
- **Step Descriptions**: Add clear descriptions to steps

### Debugging Workflows

- **Start Simple**: Begin with simple flows and add complexity gradually
- **Test Each Step**: Test steps individually before connecting them
- **Use Logging**: Add appropriate logging to track execution
- **Isolate Issues**: Use the [debugging tools](/docs/workbench/debugging-workflows) to isolate and fix issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Workbench not starting | Check if the port is already in use or if there are errors in your steps |
| Steps not appearing in visualization | Verify that steps have the correct flow name in their configuration |
| Events not triggering steps | Check that the topic names match exactly between emitter and subscriber |
| Hot reload not working | Ensure your file watcher is working and check for syntax errors |
| High CPU/memory usage | Look for infinite loops or memory leaks in your step code |
