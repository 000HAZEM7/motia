## Debugging Fundamentals

Effective debugging in Motia involves understanding:

1. **Flow Execution**: How events flow through your steps
2. **Data Transformation**: How data changes at each step
3. **Error Handling**: How errors are caught and managed
4. **State Management**: How state is maintained across steps

## The Debugging Process

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Reproduce the Issue
    
    The first step in debugging is to reliably reproduce the issue:
    
    - Identify the specific API endpoint or event that triggers the problem
    - Document the exact input data that causes the issue
    - Note the expected vs. actual behavior
    - Observe which steps are involved in the problematic flow
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Inspect the Flow Visualization
    
    The Workbench flow visualization helps you understand the execution path:
    
    - Identify which steps are being triggered
    - Check if any steps are being skipped
    - Look for unexpected branches in the flow
    - Verify that events are flowing as expected between steps
    
    <Callout>
      Click on any step in the flow visualization to see its details, including configuration and recent executions.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Analyze Logs
    
    Logs provide detailed information about what's happening during execution:
    
    - Filter logs by flow name to focus on relevant information
    - Look for error messages or warnings
    - Check the sequence of events to understand the execution order
    - Examine input and output data at each step
    
    ```
    [INFO] [payment-flow] Received request: POST /api/payments
    [DEBUG] [payment-flow] Input data: { "amount": 50.00, "currency": "USD" }
    [ERROR] [payment-flow] Failed to process payment: Invalid currency format
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Use Test Mode
    
    Test mode allows you to trigger specific parts of your flow:
    
    - Send test requests to API endpoints
    - Inject test events into specific steps
    - Monitor the flow execution in real-time
    - Inspect the data at each stage of the flow
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Add Debug Logging
    
    Enhance your steps with additional logging for debugging:
    
    ```typescript
    export const handler = async (input, { emit, logger }) => {
      // Log the input data
      logger.debug('Processing input:', input);
      
      try {
        // Process the data
        const result = processData(input);
        
        // Log the result
        logger.debug('Processing result:', result);
        
        // Emit the result
        await emit({
          topic: 'data.processed',
          data: result
        });
      } catch (error) {
        // Log the error
        logger.error('Processing failed:', error);
        throw error;
      }
    };
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Fix and Verify
    
    After identifying the issue:
    
    - Make the necessary changes to your code
    - Restart the Workbench if needed (changes are usually hot-reloaded)
    - Test the flow again to verify the fix
    - Check logs to ensure everything is working as expected
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using the Log Explorer

The Log Explorer in Motia Workbench is a powerful tool for debugging:

### Log Levels

Motia supports different log levels to help you filter information:

| Level | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| ERROR | Critical issues that prevent execution | For capturing failures and exceptions |
| WARN | Potential issues that don't stop execution | For highlighting concerning conditions |
| INFO | General information about flow execution | For tracking normal operation |
| DEBUG | Detailed information for debugging | For development and troubleshooting |
| TRACE | Very detailed information | For deep debugging of complex issues |

### Filtering Logs

The Log Explorer allows you to filter logs by:

- **Flow name**: Focus on a specific flow
- **Step name**: See logs from a particular step
- **Log level**: Filter by severity
- **Time range**: Focus on a specific time period
- **Text search**: Find logs containing specific text

### Log Context

Each log entry includes contextual information:

- **Timestamp**: When the log was generated
- **Flow**: The flow that generated the log
- **Step**: The step that generated the log
- **Trace ID**: A unique identifier for tracking a request through multiple steps
- **Log level**: The severity of the log
- **Message**: The log message
- **Data**: Any additional data included with the log

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Events Not Triggering Steps

**Symptoms**:
- A step doesn't execute when you expect it to
- Events seem to disappear

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Topic mismatch**: The emitted topic doesn't match the subscription
2. **Typos in topic names**: Small typos can cause events to be missed
3. **Missing subscription**: The step doesn't subscribe to the topic

**Solutions**:
1. Verify that the topic in the `emit()` call matches exactly what the step subscribes to
2. Check for typos in topic names
3. Ensure the step's `subscribes` array includes the correct topic

```typescript
// Emitting step
await emit({
  topic: 'order.created', // Make sure this matches exactly
  data: orderData
});

// Receiving step config
export const config = {
  type: 'event',
  name: 'ProcessOrder',
  subscribes: ['order.created'], // Must match exactly
  flows: ['order-processing']
};
```

### Data Transformation Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Data is not in the expected format at a certain step
- Steps receive incomplete or incorrect data

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Missing fields**: Required fields are not included in the event data
2. **Type mismatches**: Data types don't match expectations
3. **Transformation errors**: Data transformation logic has bugs

**Solutions**:
1. Log the input and output data at each step to track transformations
2. Add validation to ensure data meets expectations
3. Use TypeScript interfaces to enforce data structure

```typescript
// Define expected data structure
interface OrderData {
  orderId: string;
  customer: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  };
  items: Array<{
    productId: string;
    quantity: number;
    price: number;
  }>;
  total: number;
}

export const handler = async (input: OrderData, { emit, logger }) => {
  // Validate input
  if (!input.orderId || !input.customer || !Array.isArray(input.items)) {
    logger.error('Invalid order data:', input);
    throw new Error('Invalid order data');
  }
  
  // Process the order
  // ...
};
```

### Error Handling Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Errors are not caught or handled properly
- Flows stop unexpectedly
- Error information is lost

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Missing try/catch blocks**: Errors are not caught
2. **Incomplete error handling**: Errors are caught but not properly handled
3. **Async errors**: Promises are not properly awaited or caught

**Solutions**:
1. Add proper try/catch blocks around critical code
2. Log detailed error information
3. Consider emitting error events for centralized handling

```typescript
export const handler = async (input, { emit, logger }) => {
  try {
    // Process the input
    const result = await processData(input);
    
    // Emit the result
    await emit({
      topic: 'data.processed',
      data: result
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Log the error
    logger.error('Processing failed:', error);
    
    // Emit an error event
    await emit({
      topic: 'data.processing.failed',
      data: {
        input,
        error: {
          message: error.message,
          stack: error.stack
        }
      }
    });
    
    // Optionally rethrow or handle the error
    // throw error;
  }
};
```

### State Management Issues

**Symptoms**:
- State is lost between step executions
- State is not updated as expected
- Multiple instances of a step interfere with each other

**Possible Causes**:
1. **State not persisted**: State is not properly saved
2. **Race conditions**: Multiple instances of a step update state simultaneously
3. **Incorrect state keys**: State is saved under the wrong key

**Solutions**:
1. Use the state API correctly to persist state
2. Implement locking mechanisms for critical state updates
3. Use unique and consistent state keys

```typescript
export const handler = async (input, { emit, state, logger }) => {
  // Get the current state
  const currentState = await state.get('order-state') || { orders: [] };
  
  // Update the state
  currentState.orders.push(input);
  
  // Save the updated state
  await state.set('order-state', currentState);
  
  // Log the state update
  logger.debug('Updated state:', currentState);
};
```

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Step Isolation

When debugging complex flows, it can be helpful to isolate steps:

1. **Create a test flow**: Create a separate flow for testing
2. **Isolate the problematic step**: Move only the step you're debugging to the test flow
3. **Simulate inputs**: Manually trigger the step with test data
4. **Analyze behavior**: Observe how the step behaves in isolation

### Mock Dependencies

For steps that depend on external services:

1. **Create mock implementations**: Implement simplified versions of external services
2. **Control responses**: Simulate different response scenarios
3. **Test edge cases**: Test how your step handles various responses

### Debugging Multi-Language Steps

When debugging steps written in different languages:

- **Python steps**: Use Python's logging module, which integrates with Motia's logger
- **Ruby steps**: Use Ruby's logger, which also integrates with Motia
- **TypeScript/JavaScript steps**: Use the logger provided in the context

Each language has its own debugging patterns, but all logs are centralized in the Workbench.

## Best Practices for Debuggable Workflows

### Structured Logging

Use structured logging to make debugging easier:

```typescript
// Instead of this
logger.info('Processing order ' + orderId + ' for customer ' + customerId);

// Do this
logger.info('Processing order', { orderId, customerId, total });
```

### Meaningful Step Names

Choose clear, descriptive names for your steps:

```typescript
// Instead of this
export const config = {
  type: 'event',
  name: 'Step1',
  // ...
};

// Do this
export const config = {
  type: 'event',
  name: 'ValidateOrderAndCalculateTotal',
  // ...
};
```

### Modular Steps

Keep steps focused on a single responsibility:

- Easier to debug when each step does one thing well
- Clearer flow visualization
- Simpler to isolate issues

### Consistent Error Handling

Implement a consistent error handling strategy:

- Decide whether steps should fail fast or recover
- Use consistent error event topics
- Include enough context in error events

### Documentation

Document your flows and steps:

- Add comments explaining complex logic
- Document expected inputs and outputs
- Note any assumptions or requirements

## Conclusion

Effective debugging is a critical skill for developing robust Motia workflows. By leveraging the Workbench's debugging tools and following the strategies outlined in this guide, you can quickly identify and resolve issues in your flows.

Remember that good debugging often starts with good design—well-structured, modular steps with clear responsibilities are easier to debug than monolithic, complex ones.
