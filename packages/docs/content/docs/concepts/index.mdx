## Key Concepts Overview

Here's a quick overview of the most important concepts in Motia:

### Steps

Steps are the fundamental building blocks in Motia. Each step performs a specific task and can communicate with other steps through events. Motia includes several types of steps:

- **API Steps**: Create HTTP endpoints to receive external requests
- **Event Steps**: Listen for and respond to events
- **Cron Steps**: Execute on a scheduled basis
- **NOOP Steps**: Represent external processes or manual actions

[Learn more about steps →](/docs/concepts/getting-started/steps-intro)

### Events

Events are the communication mechanism between steps. When a step completes an action or reaches a certain state, it can emit an event. Other steps can listen for specific events and execute in response.

[Learn more about events →](/docs/concepts/getting-started/event-driven-basics)

### Flows

Flows are sequences of connected steps that work together to accomplish specific tasks. In Motia, flows are created implicitly through the events that connect steps.

[Learn more about flows →](/docs/concepts/getting-started/flows-intro)

### State Management

State management allows steps to share and persist data across a workflow. This is essential for building complex applications where information needs to be passed between different parts of the system.

[Learn more about state management →](/docs/concepts/core-components/state-management)

### Workbench

The Workbench is Motia's visual development environment. It allows you to visualize, test, and debug your workflows, making it easier to understand how your application works.
