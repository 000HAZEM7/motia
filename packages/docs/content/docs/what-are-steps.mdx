Steps are the language-agnostic, building blocks of a Motia app. Just like how in a React app, everything is a component, similarly, in a Motia app, everything is a Step. Conceptually, Steps are modular and reusable bits of logic, each of whom perform a specific task. They are stitched together to compose a workflow.
