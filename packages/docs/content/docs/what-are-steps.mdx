Motia is built around a single powerful primitive: the **Step**

Steps are the language-agnostic, building blocks of a Motia app. 

Just like how in a React app, everything is a component, similarly, in a Motia app, everything is a Step. Read our [introductory blog](https://dev.to/motiadev/introducing-motia-3oja-temp-slug-3967652?preview=c67eba085f74a7cf7b2c509a1548676bce436734e51ef49f52b1927b110de0fa2e214aa713e90c7a3301332e5d0eb658a6d1bdacb9a4777d93f37b52) to know more about this parallel.

Conceptually, Steps are modular and reusable bits of logic, each of whom perform a specific task. They are stitched together to compose a workflow.

## Steps are basically Lego blocks
You can think of steps like lego blocks. 
Each Step performs one job, and then optionally passes the baton. Put enough Steps together, and youâ€™ve built an entire backend system: _from an API to AI._

Intially, this might sound jarring but once you start building, it becomes clear how powerful and flexible this abstraction is. Whether you're:

- exposing an API,

- processing a queue event,

- calling an LLM,

- or even triggering a background job

Whatever you're doing, _youâ€™re always writing a Step!_

> Each Step handles a single task, then optionally hands off control to the next. Chain them together, and youâ€™ve got a full backend system - from API to AI.

## Why a new mental model?

Modern backends are no longer just about REST APIs and databases. They now include:
- Integrating AI and LLM-powered functionality
- Responding to events from dozens of sources
- Orchestrating workflows across queues, agents, and services
- Dealing with retry logic, observability, and failure recovery

Trying to manage all this with traditional patterns leads to fragmented systems. Motia offers a unified mental model: build your backend as a graph of Steps.

## What is a Step?
A Step is a language-agnostic, modular and reusable unit of logic that listens to a trigger (an API call, a queue event, a cron job etc) and processes an input using your logic. Optionally, Steps can emit follow up events or pass on data or processed result to continue the workflow.

Steps are:
- Isolated â€“ each step can run independently
- Composable â€“ steps can be connected into flows
- Multilingual â€“ write steps in TypeScript, Python, or more
- Reusable â€“ just like components, you can use the same step in multiple workflows

Two key behaviours of a Step are - Subscription and Emission. Each step can subscribe to one/many event(s) and emit one/many event(s).

Using these behaviours of a Step, you can chain different steps together by having them subscribe to the events emitted by one (or many) of the previous steps, enabling a natural event-driven flow where each Step reacts to meaningful triggers.

This lets you compose powerful, modular workflows like: listening for a user.registered event to trigger a send-welcome-email step, which in turn emits a log-onboarding-started event for analytics, all without tightly coupling your logic.

> Just like React taught us to build everything as Components. Motia teaches you to model everything as a Step.

## Ready to step up your AI-native backends?
This new abstraction might feel unfamiliar at firstâ€”but once you build with it, youâ€™ll realize how intuitive, composable, and powerful it is. Steps let you:

- Scale complexity without losing clarity

- Connect APIs, background jobs, and AI logic in one unified system

- Reuse business logic like Lego blocks across multiple workflows

- Gain observability and traceability through structured execution flows

You no longer need to juggle disconnected tools for APIs, queues, and AI agents. With Motia, everything is a Stepâ€”and that changes how we build backends for good.
