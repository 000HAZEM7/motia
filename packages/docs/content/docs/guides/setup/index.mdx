# Setup Guides

<div className="beginner-content">

Welcome to the Motia setup guides! This section will help you get started with Motia, from installation to configuration and development environment setup.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Motia, we recommend following these guides in order:

1. [Installation](/docs/guides/setup/installation) - Install Motia on your system
2. [Configuration](/docs/guides/setup/configuration) - Configure Motia for your needs
3. [Development Environment Setup](/docs/guides/setup/environment-setup) - Set up an optimal development environment

These guides will take you from zero to a fully functional Motia development environment, ready to build event-driven workflows.

## Setup for Different Environments

Motia can be set up in various environments, from local development to production deployments. Here's a quick overview of the different setup approaches:

### Local Development

For local development, you'll typically:

1. Install Motia using npm, yarn, or pnpm
2. Configure it with a basic `config.yml` file
3. Set up your development environment with your preferred editor and tools
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev`

This setup is covered in detail in the [Installation](/docs/guides/setup/installation) and [Development Environment Setup](/docs/guides/setup/environment-setup) guides.

### Team Development

For team development, consider:

1. Using Docker for consistent development environments
2. Setting up a shared configuration approach
3. Implementing testing and CI/CD pipelines
4. Establishing coding standards and conventions

The [Development Environment Setup](/docs/guides/setup/environment-setup) guide covers these topics in the intermediate and advanced sections.

### Production Deployment

For production deployments, you'll want to:

1. Configure Motia for production use
2. Set up appropriate security measures
3. Implement monitoring and logging
4. Consider scaling and high availability

The [Configuration](/docs/guides/setup/configuration) guide covers production configuration in the advanced section.

## Advanced Setup Considerations

### Multi-language Support

Motia supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Ruby. To set up a multi-language environment:

1. Install the language-specific SDKs
2. Configure Motia to recognize steps in different languages
3. Set up appropriate development tools for each language

See the [Installation](/docs/guides/setup/installation#language-specific-installation) and [Development Environment Setup](/docs/guides/setup/environment-setup#multi-language-development) guides for details.

### Containerization and Orchestration

For containerized deployments:

1. Create Docker images for your Motia application
2. Set up container orchestration with Kubernetes or similar
3. Configure networking, storage, and scaling
4. Implement monitoring and observability

The [Development Environment Setup](/docs/guides/setup/environment-setup#docker-development-environment) guide covers Docker setup, which can be extended for production use.

### Enterprise Integration

For enterprise environments:

1. Configure authentication and authorization
2. Set up integration with existing systems
3. Implement compliance and security measures
4. Establish monitoring and alerting

These topics are covered in various sections of the setup guides, particularly in the advanced sections of [Configuration](/docs/guides/setup/configuration#production-configuration).

## Common Setup Questions

### What are the system requirements for Motia?

Motia requires:
- Node.js 16 or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm for package management
- Sufficient disk space for dependencies (typically a few hundred MB)
- Memory: 512MB minimum, 1GB+ recommended

### Can I use Motia with my existing project?

Yes, you can add Motia to an existing project by installing the Motia packages and configuring it to work with your project structure. See the [Installation](/docs/guides/setup/installation#manual-installation) guide for details.

### How do I update Motia to a newer version?

To update Motia, use your package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm update @motia/core @motia/snap

# Using yarn
yarn upgrade @motia/core @motia/snap

# Using pnpm
pnpm update @motia/core @motia/snap
```

### How do I troubleshoot installation issues?

If you encounter issues during installation, check:
- Your Node.js version (`node --version`)
- Network connectivity
- Permission issues
- Compatibility with other packages

See the [Installation](/docs/guides/setup/installation#troubleshooting) guide for more troubleshooting tips.

## Next Steps

After setting up Motia, you might want to:

- Follow the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart) to build your first Motia application
- Learn about [Step Creation](/docs/guides/step-creation) to build different types of steps
- Explore the [Workbench](/docs/concepts/core-components/workbench) to visualize and debug your workflows
