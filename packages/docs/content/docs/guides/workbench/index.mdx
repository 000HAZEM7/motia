# Workbench

Motia Workbench is a powerful visual development environment that helps you build, test, and debug your Motia workflows. It serves as your command center where you can visualize flows, monitor execution, and troubleshoot issues in real-time.

## What is the Workbench?

The Workbench is a web-based interface that provides:

- **Visual Flow Representation**: See your workflows as interactive diagrams
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch events flow through your system
- **Testing Tools**: Send test requests and inject events
- **Debugging Capabilities**: Identify and fix issues quickly
- **Step Management**: Inspect and modify step configurations

## Key Features

The Workbench offers several powerful features to enhance your development experience:

### Interactive Flow Visualization

The flow visualization is the heart of the Workbench, providing a real-time, interactive view of your workflows:

- **Step Nodes**: Each step appears as a node in the diagram
- **Event Connections**: Lines show how events flow between steps
- **Color Coding**: Different step types have distinct colors
- **Status Indicators**: See which steps are active, completed, or have errors
- **Zoom and Pan**: Navigate complex flows with ease

### Real-time Testing

Test your workflows directly in the Workbench:

- **API Testing**: Send test requests to API endpoints
- **Event Injection**: Manually trigger events to test specific steps
- **Request Builder**: Construct test payloads with a user-friendly interface
- **Response Viewer**: See the responses from your API steps
- **Flow Tracing**: Watch how events propagate through your workflow

### Live Log Explorer

Monitor your workflow execution with the Log Explorer:

- **Real-time Logs**: See logs as they're generated
- **Filtering**: Filter logs by flow, step, level, or text
- **Log Levels**: View different log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- **Structured Data**: Expand structured log data for detailed inspection
- **Trace Correlation**: Follow a request through multiple steps

### Step Inspector

Examine and understand your steps in detail:

- **Configuration View**: See the step's configuration
- **Code View**: Examine the step's implementation
- **State Inspector**: View and modify the step's state
- **Recent Executions**: See the history of recent executions
- **Input/Output Data**: Inspect the data flowing through the step

### Development Tools

The Workbench includes powerful tools for development:

- **Hot Reload**: Changes to your steps are automatically reflected
- **Error Highlighting**: Errors are highlighted in the flow visualization
- **Debugging Tools**: Set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through execution
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor execution time and resource usage
- **Export/Import**: Share flows and configurations

## Getting Started with Workbench

Start the Workbench by running the development command in your Motia project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev

# Using pnpm
pnpm dev

# Using bun
bun run dev
```

Running the dev command starts:
- **Motia Server**: Backend services and API endpoints
- **Motia Workbench**: Web interface at http://localhost:3000
- **Development Mode**: Auto-reloads when changes are made to your steps

## Workbench Interface

The Workbench interface is designed to give you a complete view of your workflows:

### Main Components

1. **Navigation Bar**: Switch between different views and access settings
2. **Flow Selector**: Choose which flow to visualize and work with
3. **Flow Visualization**: Interactive diagram of your workflow
4. **Step Details Panel**: View and edit step properties
5. **Log Explorer**: Monitor and filter logs in real-time
6. **Test Panel**: Send test requests and view responses

## Workbench Guides

To learn more about specific aspects of the Workbench, check out these guides:

- [Flow Visualization](./visualization): Learn how to visualize and interact with your flows
- [Debugging Techniques](./debugging): Discover tools and strategies for debugging workflows
- [Custom UI Components](./custom-ui): Create custom visualizations for your steps
- [Performance Monitoring](./performance): Monitor and optimize your workflow performance

## Best Practices

### Organizing Flows

- **Group Related Steps**: Keep related steps in the same flow
- **Meaningful Flow Names**: Use descriptive names for flows
- **Consistent Naming**: Use a consistent naming convention for steps and flows
- **Limit Flow Size**: Keep flows to a manageable size (10-15 steps maximum)

### Effective Visualization

- **Logical Layout**: Arrange steps in a logical flow from left to right or top to bottom
- **Color Coding**: Use colors consistently to indicate step types or purposes
- **Custom Icons**: Use icons that represent the step's function
- **Step Descriptions**: Add clear descriptions to steps

### Debugging Workflows

- **Start Simple**: Begin with simple flows and add complexity gradually
- **Test Each Step**: Test steps individually before connecting them
- **Use Logging**: Add appropriate logging to track execution
- **Isolate Issues**: Use the debugging tools to isolate and fix issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Workbench not starting | Check if the port is already in use or if there are errors in your steps |
| Steps not appearing in visualization | Verify that steps have the correct flow name in their configuration |
| Events not triggering steps | Check that the topic names match exactly between emitter and subscriber |
| Hot reload not working | Ensure your file watcher is working and check for syntax errors |
| High CPU/memory usage | Look for infinite loops or memory leaks in your step code |
