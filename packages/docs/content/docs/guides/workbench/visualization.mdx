# Flow Visualization

The flow visualization is the heart of the Motia Workbench, providing an interactive, real-time view of your workflows. This guide will help you understand how to effectively use and interact with the flow visualization to build, test, and debug your Motia applications.

## Understanding the Flow Visualization

The flow visualization represents your Motia workflows as an interactive diagram:

- **Steps**: Represented as nodes in the diagram
- **Events**: Shown as connections (edges) between steps
- **Topics**: Labeled on the connections to show event routing
- **Flow Direction**: Typically flows from top to bottom or left to right

## Visualization Components

### Step Nodes

Each step in your workflow is represented as a node in the visualization:

- **API Steps**: Endpoints that receive external requests
- **Event Steps**: Steps that process events and emit new ones
- **Cron Steps**: Scheduled tasks that run at specified intervals
- **NOOP Steps**: Representations of external processes or manual actions

Each node type has a distinct visual appearance to help you quickly identify different step types in your workflow.

### Event Connections

Connections between steps show how events flow through your workflow:

- **Source**: The step that emits the event
- **Target**: The step that subscribes to the event
- **Topic**: The event topic that connects the steps
- **Direction**: Indicated by arrows showing event flow

### Status Indicators

The visualization includes status indicators to show the current state of your workflow:

- **Active**: Steps that are currently processing
- **Completed**: Steps that have finished execution
- **Error**: Steps that encountered errors
- **Waiting**: Steps that are waiting for events

These indicators help you track the execution of your workflow in real-time.

## Interacting with the Visualization

### Navigation

You can navigate the flow visualization using these controls:

- **Pan**: Click and drag to move around the diagram
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel or pinch gesture to zoom in and out
- **Reset**: Click the reset button to return to the default view
- **Fit View**: Click the fit view button to see the entire workflow

### Selecting Steps

Click on any step to select it and view its details:

- **Step Configuration**: See the step's configuration
- **Step Code**: View the step's implementation
- **Recent Executions**: See the history of recent executions
- **Input/Output Data**: Inspect the data flowing through the step

### Rearranging Steps

You can rearrange steps in the visualization to create a more logical layout:

1. Click and hold on a step to select it
2. Drag the step to a new position
3. Release to place the step

The connections between steps will automatically adjust to the new layout.

### Filtering and Focusing

You can filter and focus the visualization to concentrate on specific parts of your workflow:

- **Flow Selection**: Choose which flow to visualize
- **Step Filtering**: Filter steps by type, name, or other criteria
- **Focus Mode**: Focus on a specific step and its immediate connections

## Customizing the Visualization

### Layout Options

The Workbench offers several layout options to help you organize your workflow visualization:

- **Automatic Layout**: Automatically arrange steps for optimal visualization
- **Horizontal Layout**: Arrange steps from left to right
- **Vertical Layout**: Arrange steps from top to bottom
- **Custom Layout**: Manually position steps as desired

### Visual Customization

You can customize the appearance of steps in the visualization:

- **Color Coding**: Assign colors to steps based on their purpose or status
- **Icons**: Use custom icons to represent different step types
- **Labels**: Customize the labels shown on steps and connections
- **Grouping**: Group related steps together for better organization

## Advanced Visualization Features

### UI Steps

UI Steps allow you to create custom visualizations for your steps:

```typescript
// customStep.step.tsx
import React from 'react'
import { EventNode } from 'motia/workbench'
import type { EventNodeProps } from 'motia/workbench'

export default function CustomStep({ data }: EventNodeProps) {
  return (
    <EventNode
      data={data}
      variant="white"
      shape="rounded"
      className="py-2 px-4"
    >
      <div>Custom content</div>
    </EventNode>
  )
}
```

UI Steps give you complete control over how your steps appear in the visualization, allowing you to create intuitive, context-aware visual components.

### NOOP Steps

NOOP Steps represent external processes or manual actions in your workflow:

```typescript
// externalProcess.step.ts
export const config = {
  type: 'noop',
  name: 'External Process',
  description: 'Represents an external system or manual process',
  virtualEmits: ['process.completed'],
  virtualSubscribes: ['process.started'],
  flows: ['my-flow']
}
```

NOOP Steps help you visualize the complete workflow, including parts that happen outside your Motia application.

## Real-time Visualization

The flow visualization updates in real-time as events flow through your system:

- **Active Steps**: Highlighted as they process events
- **Event Flow**: Animated to show events moving between steps
- **State Changes**: Updated to reflect changes in step state
- **Errors**: Highlighted when steps encounter errors

This real-time visualization helps you understand how your workflow behaves during execution.

## Best Practices

### Organizing Flows

- **Group Related Steps**: Keep related steps in the same flow
- **Meaningful Flow Names**: Use descriptive names for flows
- **Consistent Naming**: Use a consistent naming convention for steps and flows
- **Limit Flow Size**: Keep flows to a manageable size (10-15 steps maximum)

### Effective Visualization

- **Logical Layout**: Arrange steps in a logical flow from left to right or top to bottom
- **Color Coding**: Use colors consistently to indicate step types or purposes
- **Custom Icons**: Use icons that represent the step's function
- **Step Descriptions**: Add clear descriptions to steps

### Sharing and Collaboration

- **Export Layouts**: Save and share your visualization layouts
- **Screenshots**: Capture visualizations for documentation
- **Consistent Styling**: Use consistent styling across your team

## Troubleshooting

### Common Visualization Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Steps not appearing | Verify that steps have the correct flow name in their configuration |
| Connections missing | Check that topic names match exactly between emitter and subscriber |
| Layout issues | Try using the automatic layout or manually rearrange steps |
| Performance problems | Reduce the number of steps visible at once or use filtering |
