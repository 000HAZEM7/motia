| **Agentic Support** | ✅ Agentic flexibility per step | ❌ Minimal or none | ✅ Core functionality | ⚠️ Through additional layers | ⚠️ Custom implementation |
| **Long-term Maintainability** | ✅ Standard patterns & versioning | ❌ Vendor lock-in risks | ⚠️ Rapidly evolving ecosystem | ⚠️ Dependent on model versions | ✅ Complete control but higher burden |

## Motia Workbench: Your Development Control Center

Motia Workbench is a built-in, browser-based development platform that acts as your central hub for building, testing, and debugging Motia flows. Key features include:

- **Interactive Flow Visualization:**  See your workflows come to life as dynamic diagrams, making it easy to understand complex event flows and step interactions.

- **Real-time Flow Testing:**  Trigger API endpoints and monitor event propagation through your steps, all within the Workbench UI. Inspect data at each stage to ensure your flows are behaving as expected.

- **Live Log Streaming:**  Access detailed, real-time logs directly in the Workbench. Filter and search logs to quickly pinpoint issues and monitor workflow execution.

- **Step-Level Customization:**  Create custom UI components for your steps to enhance visualization and provide context-specific information directly within the flow diagram.
