# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you get up and running with Motia in just a few minutes. You'll install Motia, understand the starter example, and make your first change.

## 5-Minute Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1. Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir my-motia-project
cd my-motia-project
```

2. Initialize a new Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

3. Install Motia:

```bash
npm install @motia/core @motia/snap
```

4. Create a starter project:

```bash
npx @motia/snap create
```

This command creates a basic Motia project with a simple workflow that includes NOOP, API, and event steps.

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your Motia project is now running! You can access the Workbench at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Understanding the Example

The starter example includes three types of steps that form the foundation of any Motia workflow:

### NOOP Step

The NOOP (No Operation) step represents an external process or action. In the starter example, it's used to simulate a user action.

```typescript
// steps/starter/noop.ts
import { defineStep } from '@motia/core';

export default defineStep({
  id: 'starter.noop',
  name: 'Starter NOOP',
  type: 'noop',
  emits: ['starter.noop.completed'],
  run: async (input, { emit }) => {
    // This step doesn't do anything but emit an event
    await emit('starter.noop.completed', { message: 'NOOP step completed' });
    return { success: true };
  }
});
```

### API Step

The API step creates an HTTP endpoint that can be called to trigger your workflow.

```typescript
// steps/starter/api.ts
import { defineStep } from '@motia/core';

export default defineStep({
  id: 'starter.api',
  name: 'Starter API',
  type: 'api',
  path: '/api/starter',
  method: 'POST',
  emits: ['starter.api.received'],
  run: async (input, { emit }) => {
    // When this endpoint is called, emit an event
    await emit('starter.api.received', { 
      message: 'API request received',
      data: input.body
    });
    return { success: true };
  }
});
```

### Event Step

The Event step listens for events and performs actions in response.

```typescript
// steps/starter/event.ts
import { defineStep } from '@motia/core';

export default defineStep({
  id: 'starter.event',
  name: 'Starter Event',
  type: 'event',
  on: ['starter.noop.completed', 'starter.api.received'],
  run: async (input) => {
    console.log('Event received:', input.event);
    console.log('Event data:', input.data);
    return { success: true };
  }
});
```

## Making Your First Change

Let's modify the Event step to do something more interesting:

1. Open the file `steps/starter/event.ts`
2. Update the `run` function to process the incoming data:

```typescript
run: async (input) => {
  console.log('Event received:', input.event);
  
  // Process the data differently based on the event type
  if (input.event === 'starter.noop.completed') {
    console.log('NOOP event completed with message:', input.data.message);
  } else if (input.event === 'starter.api.received') {
    console.log('API request received with data:', input.data.data);
    
    // Add some data processing
    const processedData = {
      ...input.data.data,
      processed: true,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    
    console.log('Processed data:', processedData);
  }
  
  return { 
    success: true,
    processedAt: new Date().toISOString()
  };
}
```

3. Save the file and the changes will be automatically applied.

4. Test your changes:
   - Go to the Workbench at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Click on the NOOP step to trigger it
   - Check the console logs to see your enhanced processing
   - Use a tool like curl or Postman to send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/api/starter` with some JSON data

## Next Steps

Now that you've got a basic Motia workflow running, here are some suggestions for what to explore next:

- **Learn more about steps**: Explore the [different step types](/docs/concepts/core-components/step-types) and how they work together.
- **Understand event-driven architecture**: Dive into [event-driven basics](/docs/concepts/getting-started/event-driven-basics) to understand the foundation of Motia.
- **Follow a learning journey**: Start the [Motia Journey](/docs/journeys/start-your-motia-journey) for a guided learning experience.
- **Build something real**: Try one of our [real-world tutorials](/docs/real-world-tutorials) to build a practical application.
- **Explore the Workbench**: Learn how to use the [Workbench](/docs/concepts/core-components/workbench) to visualize and debug your workflows.

Happy building with Motia!
