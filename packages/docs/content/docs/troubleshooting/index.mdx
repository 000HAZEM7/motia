# Troubleshooting Overview

This section provides resources to help you diagnose and resolve issues with your Motia workflows. Whether you're encountering errors, performance problems, or unexpected behavior, you'll find guidance here to get your workflows back on track.

## How to Use This Section

The troubleshooting resources are organized to help you find solutions quickly:

- **[Common Errors](./common-errors)**: A catalog of frequently encountered errors with explanations and solutions
- **[Debugging Guide](./debugging-guide)**: Step-by-step approaches to diagnose issues in your workflows
- **[Performance Issues](./performance-issues)**: Solutions for workflows that are slow or consuming too many resources
- **[FAQ](./faq)**: Quick answers to frequently asked questions

## Troubleshooting Process

When you encounter an issue with your Motia workflow, we recommend following this process:

1. **Identify the symptoms**: What exactly is happening? Is it an error message, unexpected behavior, or performance issue?
2. **Check the logs**: Motia provides detailed logs that can help pinpoint the source of the problem
3. **Consult the documentation**: Look for similar issues in our troubleshooting guides
4. **Isolate the problem**: Try to reproduce the issue in a simplified workflow
5. **Apply the solution**: Implement the recommended fix and test your workflow

## Using the Workbench for Troubleshooting

The Motia Workbench is a powerful tool for diagnosing issues:

1. **Visualize the workflow**: See the flow of events and identify where things might be going wrong
2. **Inspect state**: Check the state at different points in your workflow
3. **Monitor events**: See which events are being emitted and received
4. **Step through execution**: Follow the execution path to find where issues occur

```typescript
// Example: Adding detailed logging to help troubleshoot
export const handler = async (input, { emit, state, logger }) => {
  // Log the input for debugging
  logger.debug('Received input:', input);
  
  try {
    // Your step logic here
    const result = await processData(input);
    
    // Log the result
    logger.debug('Processing result:', result);
    
    // Emit an event with the result
    await emit('data.processed', result);
    
    return { success: true };
  } catch (error) {
    // Log the error with details
    logger.error('Error processing data:', error);
    logger.error('Input that caused the error:', input);
    
    // You might want to emit an error event
    await emit('data.processing.error', { 
      error: error.message,
      input
    });
    
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
};
```

## Common Troubleshooting Scenarios

Here are some of the most common issues you might encounter:

### 1. Events Not Being Received

If steps aren't receiving expected events:

- Check that the emitting step is correctly specifying the event topic
- Verify that the receiving step is subscribing to the correct topic
- Ensure that the event payload structure matches what the receiving step expects
- Check for typos in event topic names

### 2. State Management Issues

If you're having trouble with state:

- Verify that keys are consistent across steps
- Check that you're handling asynchronous state operations correctly
- Ensure you're not exceeding size limits for state values
- Consider using namespaced keys to avoid conflicts

### 3. API Steps Not Working

If API endpoints aren't functioning as expected:

- Confirm the path and method are correctly configured
- Check that request validation is working as intended
- Verify that the response format matches what clients expect
- Test the endpoint directly using tools like curl or Postman

### 4. Performance Problems

If workflows are running slowly:

- Look for unnecessary state operations
- Check for inefficient event patterns
- Consider parallel processing for independent operations
- Optimize external API calls and database queries
