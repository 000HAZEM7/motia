## Motia Workbench: Your Development Control Center

Motia Workbench is a built-in, browser-based development platform that acts as your central hub for building, testing, and debugging Motia flows. Key features include:

- **Interactive Flow Visualization:**  See your workflows come to life as dynamic diagrams, making it easy to understand complex event flows and step interactions.

- **Real-time Flow Testing:**  Trigger API endpoints and monitor event propagation through your steps, all within the Workbench UI. Inspect data at each stage to ensure your flows are behaving as expected.

- **Live Log Streaming:**  Access detailed, real-time logs directly in the Workbench. Filter and search logs to quickly pinpoint issues and monitor workflow execution.

- **Step-Level Customization:**  Create custom UI components for your steps to enhance visualization and provide context-specific information directly within the flow diagram.

## Core Concepts: Building Blocks of Motia

Motia workflows are built using a few core concepts that work together harmoniously:

| Concept    | Description                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Steps**  | Self-contained, reusable units of business logic. Steps subscribe to events, process data, and emit events. |
| **Flows**  | Logical groupings of related steps that together accomplish a specific task or process.                     |
| **Events** | Messages that are emitted by steps and trigger other steps that subscribe to them.                          |
| **Topics** | Named channels or categories for events, enabling event routing and decoupling between steps.              |
